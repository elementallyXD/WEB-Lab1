                        <p>On 12 March 1986, Christian, Claude, Gérard, Michel and Yves Guillemot, five brothers of the Guillemot family, founded Ubi Soft in Carentoir, a small village located in the Morbihan department of France's Brittany region.[4] Yves
                            Guillemot soon made deals with Electronic Arts, Sierra On-Line and MicroProse to distribute their games in France. By the end of the decade, Ubi Soft began expanding to other markets, including the United States, the United
                            Kingdom and Germany. They entered the video game distribution and wholesale markets, and by 1993 they had become the largest distributor of video games in France.[5] In the early 1990s, Ubi Soft initiated its in-house game
                            development program, which led to the 1994 opening of a studio in Montreuil, which later became their primary operating offices. Ubi Soft became a publicly traded company in 1996 and continued its expansion around the globe,
                            opening locations in Annecy (1996), Shanghai (1996), Montreal (1997), and Milan (1998). In March 2001, Gores Technology Group sold The Learning Company's entertainment division (which includes games originally published by
                            Brøderbund, Mattel, Mindscape and Strategic Simulations) to them. The sale included the rights to intellectual properties such as the Myst and Prince of Persia series.[6] In July 2006, Ubisoft bought the Driver franchise from
                            Atari for a sum of €19 million in cash for the franchise, technology rights, and most assets. In July 2008, Ubisoft made the acquisition of Hybride Technologies, a Piedmont-based studio renowned for its expertise in the creation
                            of visual effects for cinema, television and advertising. In November 2008, Ubisoft acquired Massive Entertainment from Activision.[7] In January 2013, Ubisoft acquired South Park: The Stick of Truth from THQ for $3.265 million.
                            On 9 September 2003, Ubi Soft announced that they would change their name to simply Ubisoft, and introduced a new logo known as "the swirl".[8][9] In December 2004, rival gaming corporation Electronic Arts purchased a 19.9%
                            stake in the firm, an action Ubisoft referred to as "hostile" on EA's part.[10] Ubisoft announced plans in 2013 to invest $373 million into its Quebec operations over seven years, a move that is expected to generate 500 additional
                            jobs in the province. The publisher is investing in the expansion of its motion capture technologies, and consolidating its online games operations and infrastructure in Montreal. By 2020, the company will employ more than
                            3,500 staff at its studios in Montreal and Quebec City.[11] In March 2015, the company set up a Consumer Relationship Centre in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The centre is intended to integrate consumer support teams and community managers.
                            Consumer Support and Community Management teams at the CRC are operational seven days a week.[12] In May 2017, Ubisoft announced that they had changed their logo to a simplistic, minimalistic version of the former representation.</p>
