                    <h2>Description:</h2>
                    Might & Magic Heroes VII (MMH7) is a turn-based strategy game in the Heroes of Might and Magic series. Like the other games in the series, players control leaders with magical abilities termed as "heroes", who recruit a variety of forces from strongholds.
                    The heroes and their armies battle the opponents, who also use heroes to lead their forces. It features a campaign series of levels, standalone and multiplayer scenarios. In 2016, the downloadable content Lost Tales of Axeoth was released.
                    On August 4, 2016 Trial by Fire was released, featuring two new campaigns, new faction (fortress) and many gameplay improvements available for all owners of the main game as well. However, the expansion itself is sold as standalone.
                    Along with the expansion the game was updated to feature Denuvo DRM (since version 2.0). While all versions of MMH7 include a random map generator in the map editor[2], the Trial by Fire expansion added an in-game random map generator
                    (which can also be used in other version of MMH7)[3][4] Two months after the release of the last expansion Ubisoft announced[5] that further game development was halted which left many critical bugs unresolved.
